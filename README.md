# Z80 Development Tools

This repo included a script to build GNU binutils for z80 and llvm with a patch allowing it to output assembly code that works with the GNU assembler.

The work in this repo is based off the following repos:

* https://github.com/jacobly0/llvm-project
* https://github.com/codebje/ez80-toolchain
